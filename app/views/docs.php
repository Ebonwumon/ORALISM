<h2>Search Module</h2>

<p>While performing searches there are two main pages. The first page
is the search page where a query is input. The second page is the
results page where the results of a search are displayed.</p>

<h4>Making a search</h4>

<p>To get to the search page, click the Search button on the navigation bar.
To make a query against existing records, type the query into the textbox
labelled search and click the button labelled SEARCH. This will take you to the
search results page (explained below).</p>

<h4>Limiting a search based on dates</h4>

<p>The query can be narrowed down by specifying the start and end date. If only
the start date is specified then all records matching the query after that date
will be displayed. If only the end date is specified then all records matching
the query before that date will be displayed. If both are specified then only
records matching the query that fall between those two dates will be displayed.</p>

<p>The dates selected are inclusive in the search results. Meaning that the
records displayed will be from the start date, inclusive, to the end date, also
inclusive.</p>

<p>It is possible to leave the query blank and only select dates. If this is
done then the search results will contain all records between the selected
dates, based on the description above.</p>

<h4>Search result ordering</h4>

<p>There are three different ways to order the results. These can be selected
from the radio buttons below the date entry.</p>

<p>The first method is by relevancy. If this button is selected then the results
will be displayed based on the relevancy of the record to the search query. If
the search query is left blank then the results have no guaranteed ordering.</p>

<p>The second and third method are most-recent-first, and most-recent-last. These
two methods order the results based on test date. The records with the most
recent and least recent test dates are displayed first respectively.</p>

<h4>Viewing search results</h4>

<p>Search results are displayed on a separate page after clicking the search
button on the search page. If the given query matches no records then the
text "No Results Found!" will be displayed. Otherwise a table of matching
records will be displayed. The table displays the patient, doctor,
radiologist, test type, prescribing date, test date, diagnosis, description,
and thumbnails.</p>

<h3>Viewing record images</h3>

<p>There are two ways to view record images from the search results page. The
first method is to click on the images thumbnail in the search results table.
This will open a new window containing the image. The two buttons can be used
to increase or decrease the size of the image.</p>

<p>The second method to view a records images is to click on the "View" button in
the same row as the record you want to view images for. This will take you to
the records page. At the bottom of this page is a list of images for the
record. Again the two buttons can be used to increase or decrease the size of
the image.</p>
